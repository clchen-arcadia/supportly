# Supportly

A simple support ticket management system.  

Anonymous/client users can submit tickets with name/email/description.  

Signup and login is available for admin accounts. Admins can view all tickets and click into tickets to update the ticket status ('new', 'in-progress', or 'resolved'). They can also send a dummy email response to the ticket submitter which is simply logged in the backend.  

Project is build with a React.js frontend deployed on Netlify, a Flask Python/SQLAlchemy backend deployed on Render, and a PostgreSQL database deployed on ElephantSQL.
